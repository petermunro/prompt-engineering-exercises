# Exercise 2: From Keywords to Conversations

Objective: Demonstrate through hands-on experimentation how transforming short keyword searches into full conversational prompts with context and examples better targets large language model responses for precise needs.

### Instructions

1. Identify 2-3 recent Google searches you have performed on topics of your choice (for example, recipe ideas, sports scores, local events, etc).
2. Write down the short keyword-based search queries you used.
3. Reformulate each search string into a fully conversational prompt question for a large language model, including:

- Full sentences and question phrasing
- Relevant background context
- Desired type of response and details
- Example output to illustrate

4. Run your original keyword prompt and your new conversational prompt with an LLM and compare results.
5. Identify areas your conversational prompt provides clearer instructions and focuses the response versus the keyword string.
