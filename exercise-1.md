# Exercise 1: Be Specific and Clear

Objective: Craft Three Variations of a Basic Prompt

### Instructions

Create and run the following prompt variations separately (each in a new chat) and compare the type of names suggested:

1. Write a basic prompt asking the language model to suggest names for a new cafe opening in your city.
2. Make the prompt more specific by providing details like target audience, desired cafe atmosphere, and speciality menu items.
3. Improve clarity further by explaining you need 5 short, creative name ideas ideal for the local market and social media, giving two examples of other local cafes.

The purpose is to show how even simple changes like adding critical details and context significantly impact prompt results. You will quickly grasp how specificity focuses the desired response while clarity aligns it closely with expectations through upfront instructions and illustrations.
